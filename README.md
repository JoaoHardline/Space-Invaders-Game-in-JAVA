# Space-Invaders-Game_JAVA
This is part of my Final project in object oriented programming course at USP - University of SÃ£o Paulo

The game tries to be as similar as possible with the original game, made in 1978 by Tomohiro Nishikado, except for its appearance.
The design flirts with Doom game context, a game wich I enjoyed a lot playing and like its visuals.

When I submitted the project for evaluation, that's what it looked like:

In the future, I will propably implement more features for the game, such as stages and a menu.
Feel free to send a pull request with a new feature :)
